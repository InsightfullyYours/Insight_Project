	<h2>The AIDS Crisis in the U.S.: Introduction</h2>

	<p>
	The AIDS crisis of the late 20th century was the defining public health emergency of a generation; a crisis caused by a disease
	whose initial spread outpaced the ability for scientists to determine its rates and transmission methods.  The first official reporting
	on AIDS came on June 5th, 1981 in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)â€™s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR).
	The initial report described five young gay men in Los Angeles who had contracted a rare lung infection and a number of other rare infections
	characteristic of severely immunosuppressed patients.  After press coverage of the MMWR,the CDC received numerous reports about similar groupings
	of rare and opportunistic infections among gay men across the country.  By the end of 1981, there were a cumulative total of 270 cases of severely
	immunosuppressed gay patients; 121 of those cases had already proved fatal.  Despite the efforts of government and researches, HIV/AIDS continued
	to spread throughout the 1980s and 1990s; by 1994, HIV/AIDS had become the leading cause of death in the U.S. for people aged 25-44 years old.

	The AIDS crisis is one of the first large-scale public health crises to take place during the relative availability of computer computation.
	The early 1980s saw the release of the Commodore 64, the IBM personal computer, and the Macintosh.  The data that was collected during the
	crisis was therefore more comprehensive and easily correlated than that in previous crises.  The identification of transmission methods and the
	identification of the retrovirus that causes AIDS as well as the concurrent development of a diagnostic blood test are all,
	in many ways, due to the breadth and depth of data available to researchers for the first time.  Many writers, for example, credit the sharing
	of research data between the American scientist Robert Gallo and the French scientist Luc Montagnier for the breakthrough understanding that
	AIDS is a retrovirus primarily transmitted through blood and sexual fluids.  The data collected both during and after the AIDS crisis in America
	is available in anonymized form online from the <a href=https://wonder.cdc.gov/aidspublic.html>CDC WONDER AIDS Database<a>.
	This project aims to explore the data available from 1981-2002 in order to quantify the devastation wrought by the AIDS crisis.
