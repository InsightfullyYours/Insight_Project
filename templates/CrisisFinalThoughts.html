	<h2>Final Thoughts on the AIDS Crisis</h2>

	<p>
	The AIDS crisis in the U.S. was the defining U.S. public health crisis of the late 20th century.  AIDS devastated families and communities and was,
	for a time, the leading cause of death for all Americans between the ages of 25 and 44.  It also took place as the accessibility and prevalence of
	computers increased, allowing a more rapid tabulation of data and search for understanding.  Much of that data is now available to the public.
	By analyzing that data, we can explore the evolution and landscape of the AIDS crisis and see its major impact on the gay community of the late 20th century.
	We have analyzed the data based upon year of diagnosis, HIV exposure mechanism, and the age range at diagnosis.  The resulting graphs were discussed in the
	context of the AIDS crisis and its effects on the gay community in the U.S. of the late 20th century.  The graph that presents the most direct visualization
	of this effect is shown below.  Figure 10 shows the devastation of the early years, when an AIDS diagnosis was a death sentence.  It shows the incremental
	success of AZT, the first antiretroviral drug (FDA approved March 19, 1987), as well as the success of the HAART methodology in decreasing AIDS mortality.

	The CDC Wonder AIDS database presents a comprehensive chronicle of one of the greatest public health crises in the last fifty years, which is why it was chosen.
	This analysis quantifies and presents the scope and impact of the AIDS crisis in the U.S. in a way that is simple but effective, producing in a few graphs a
	clear picture of the devastation wrought on the gay community by AIDS.  It also highlights the importance of data collection to public health â€“ without complete
	patient histories and robust data analysis the ability to trace new outbreaks and transmission methods may be compromised.

	We now invite you to explore a part of the database that was not discussed up to this point: the Location data.  Please use the menu or the navigation buttons
	to go to the Explore the AIDS Crisis Through Location Data section to further investigate the database.
